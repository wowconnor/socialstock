# socialstock

## The Idea:
  The purpose of a social stock trading application is to promote something we call 'collaborative investing'.
The application allows users to create stock portfolios that they can then share within an online community. These portfolios will then be judged by the community for their investment worthiness, potential value or otherwise unique dynamic. While users are encouraged to create portfolios that they, themselves, would purchase for investment, this is not a requirement as not all who are interested in stock investing have the capital to support certain portfolios. Any portfolio can be assembled by any user, but only the most useful shall rise to dominate the shared space and assist in the decision making and research of potential stock investors.

## The Purpose:
  It is a known fact that the stock market follows human behavioral trends, amongst other things. This allows for social media and blog posting websites to have a strong influence on the market and as such the value of a stock. We believe this same influence can be applied to an entire portfolio of stocks. It is our goal to gather the information of the stock in depth AND generate the ability to create the portfolio AND provide the opportunity to share one's thoughts or one's research on the details of an individual stock or portfolio all into one place. We believe this shared space will allow experts to discuss the nuance of trading and for beginners to learn from the interactions of experts. This application will act as a place to learn, share and experiment.

## The Features:
  This application hosts a few primary features:
    (1) Portfolio Creation
      > Users will be able to build Stock portfolios using the latest stock market APIs.
      > Portfolios will automatically tally the price of investment.
      > Portfolios can either be listed as verified (owned by the creator) or simply hypothetical.
      > Once built, a stock portfolios are shared into a social media setting.
    (2) Collaborative Investing
      > Users will be alerted of the similarity rating of their portfolios to others that have been created.
      > Users will be able to comment, like, subscribe among other relation actions with other users.
