  Today, Myself, Connor Marks, in collaboration with Christian Park, have begun the storyboard for a financial app that brings together 
  the functionality of stock selection, trade making and profit/loss tracking with the social media presence of reddit or like-minded, casual 
  idea sharing websites. This document will serve as the record kept on the subject of that idea and application's development thoughout its 
  entire life cycle.
