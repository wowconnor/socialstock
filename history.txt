  Today, Myself, Connor Marks, in collaboration with Christian Park, have begun the storyboard for a financial app that brings together 
  the functionality of stock selection, trade making and profit/loss tracking with the social media presence of reddit or like-minded, casual 
  idea sharing websites. This document will serve as the record kept on the subject of that idea and application's development thoughout its 
  entire life cycle.

  Chistian made forward movement with hosting the application using django to support what will be our Python backend. I worked on the markdown file
  which I will continue to do throughout development.

  Christian creates proposal to use yfinance api in order to retrieve stock data:
  Sources can be found here. https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/ 
    - Using the Public API (without authentication), you are limited to 2,000 requests per hour per IP (or up to a total of 48,000 requests a day)

  Potential Data Visualization method: Cufflinks/Pandas? https://plotly.com/python/candlestick-charts/
